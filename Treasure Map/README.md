# Instructions
This is a difficult challenge. 💪

You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map:

Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a letter-number system.
